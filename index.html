  Building reliable distributed systems is challenging for many reasons.
  Such systems must tolerate faults gracefully: machines may crash, new
  nodes may suddenly join or leave the system, and the network may drop,
  reorder, or duplicate packets. Distributed systems are also highly
  concurrent; engineers must ensure that for any schedule of events, the
  system's key correctness guarantees are maintained and that the service
  remains available.  Furthermore, large-scale applications are often built by
  composing services from multiple distributed systems, requiring
  developers to reason about interactions between different systems.

  To help address these challenges, the

  (or "DisCo" for short) project provides reusable infrastructure for
  formally verifying distributed systems using the <a href=''>Coq</a> proof
  assistant.
